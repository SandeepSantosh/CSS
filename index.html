Hello,
You need a sharp candidate with great attention to detail and excellent skills. My education and training make me an ideal candidate for this position.
My educational background has prepared me as a specialist. In particular, my study of Masters in Computer Science(MSCS) and Masters in Information Assurance(MSIA)  has given me a solid background, as a Graduate student I co-ordinate and assist in the planning and implementation of large programming events with a focus on providing high quality prevention and education. I am eager to contribute my enthusiasm and up to date skills to the team.
I am certain that my resume will give a greater understanding on my qualifications for this exciting opportunity.
I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with and learn from you and your talented team. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Sincerely,
SANDEEP
